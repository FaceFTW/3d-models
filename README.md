# 3d-models
A bunch of 3D Models I created for 3D printing.

## Black Mesa Emblem
Took a Black Mesa SVG I found online and converted it into an emblem to attach to a bag via Fabric Tape. Intentionally Large to maintain detail, can be scaled down as desired.

Includes Fusion360 and STL Files

## I'm not going to sugarcoat it
Funny Tekken emblem

## Octoprint Case Remix
Remix of ArtieH's Raspberry Pi 4B Octoprint case with the following modifications:
- Removal of Octoprint logo (not my thing)
- Covering of GPIO Slot (removable)
- Allowing Display cable to be used

Includes Fusion360 and STL files. Fusion 360 contains Raspberry Pi dummy model for measuring purposes.
